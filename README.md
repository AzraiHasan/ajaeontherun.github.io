My website v0.1.0

This is my first attempt of building my own website. Just wanted to see if I can learn something new during the covid-19 lockdown.
I'd appreciate any constructive feedback. Please advise and guide me on what I should learn next.

I would love to obtain the skills and knowledge to become a full-stack developer!

Thanks for checking out my repo!
